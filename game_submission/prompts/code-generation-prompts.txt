You are an AI game developer specializing in creating educational, impactful web-based games using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (front-end only).

Create a 2D browser game titled “Sidewalk Policy”, themed around urban management and social equity in Vietnam.

🎮 Game Concept

Players act as Urban Policy Officers responsible for managing sidewalks in a crowded city.
They must balance between enforcing regulations (clearing sidewalks for safety) and protecting local livelihoods (street vendors, small shops).

The game reflects real-world social tensions between public order, economy, and community well-being, promoting empathy and understanding of policy trade-offs.

🧩 Gameplay Mechanics

Draw Cards Phase:

Player draws 3 random “Policy Cards.”

Each card has:

Action name (e.g., “Increase Patrols”, “Support Vendors”, “Public Awareness Campaign”)

Cost (management budget points)

Effect (+/-) on three indicators:

Public Order

Local Livelihood

Community Trust

Decision Phase:

Player can play 1–2 cards per turn (depending on available management budget).

Each action modifies the 3 indicators accordingly.

Evaluation Phase:

If Local Livelihood falls too low → player draws a Penalty Card (“Community Pressure”, “Media Backlash”).

If Public Order drops too low → “Traffic Congestion” or “Safety Issues” events occur.

Win / Lose Conditions:

Win: Reach the goal “Clear and Fair Sidewalks” — Public Order ≥ 80 and Local Livelihood ≥ 60 before budget runs out.

Lose: Budget = 0 or Community Trust ≤ 30.

🧠 Educational Impact

The game teaches players about policy trade-offs and inclusive urban management, helping them experience the challenge of making fair, sustainable decisions.

🖼️ Game UI Requirements

Must include at least:

Menu Screen: Title, “Start Game,” and “How to Play.”

Play Screen:

3 drawn cards displayed visually.

HUD showing indicators (Public Order, Livelihood, Community Trust, Budget).

Buttons to confirm actions and end turn.

Result Screen:

Shows Win/Lose message.

Summary of player decisions and outcomes.

🧱 Technical Requirements

Front-end only (HTML, CSS, JS).

Use basic animations or transitions for feedback.

No backend or installation needed — must run fully in browser.

You may use TailwindCSS, p5.js, or anime.js for UI and animation.

Generate minimal but clear art assets (e.g., icons, cards, indicators) — can be AI-generated placeholders.

🗂️ Deliverables

index.html — main structure

style.css — design and layout

script.js — logic, interactivity, and indicators

Comments in code explaining logic and AI-generated parts

🧭 Evaluation Alignment

Creativity: Card-based policy management mechanic.

Gameplay & UX: Simple, balanced, and visually clear.

Technical Execution: Clean JS structure and functional UI.

Documentation: Include a README summarizing the prompt, gameplay, and learning outcomes.

Now generate:

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code for this game.
