# Sidewalk Policy - Urban Management Game

An educational browser-based card game that simulates the challenges of urban sidewalk management in Vietnamese cities.

## Overview

**Sidewalk Policy** is a strategic card game where players take on the role of an Urban Policy Officer managing sidewalks in a crowded Vietnamese city. The game teaches players about policy trade-offs and the delicate balance between public order, local livelihoods, and community trust.

Players must make difficult decisions using policy cards while managing a limited budget and dealing with random events. Every decision has consequences - enforcement actions that improve order may devastate vendor livelihoods, while supporting vendors may lead to sidewalk congestion.

## Features

### Core Gameplay
- **52 Policy Cards** - Diverse cards inspired by real Vietnamese urban policies
- **4 Indicators** - Public Order, Local Livelihood, Community Trust, and Budget
- **Random Events** - Decision events (30% per turn) and objective events (every 3 turns)
- **Strategic Depth** - 70% of cards have negative trade-offs, requiring careful planning

### Game Mechanics
- Draw 3 cards per turn, play 1-2 cards
- Win by reaching 100 in ALL three indicators simultaneously
- Lose if ANY indicator drops to 0 or budget runs out
- Dynamic scoring system with achievements
- Top 10 high score leaderboard with result images

### Visual Design
- Modern glass morphism UI with backdrop blur effects
